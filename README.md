# variatoinal_NP_BMM

INTRODUCTION
------------
The following is a toolbox that performs variational inferences of Baysina mixture models. The implimentation currently includes Gaussian mixture models and Von Mises-Fisher mixture models. The priors on the weight distribution include non-paramteric disributions such as the Dirichlet proecess and the Pitman-Yor process, and parametric distributions such as the Dirichlet distribution.
