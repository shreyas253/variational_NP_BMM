# variational_NP_BMM

INTRODUCTION
------------
The following is a toolbox that performs variational inferences of Bayesian mixture models. The implementation currently includes Gaussian mixture models and Von Mises-Fisher mixture models. The priors on the weight distribution include non-parametric distributions such as the Dirichlet process and the Pitman-Yor process, and parametric distributions such as the Dirichlet distribution.

This also forms the source code related to our work

METHODS
-------
The nonparametric priors included in the toolbox are constructed based on a stick-breaking process, and variational inference in the DPMM and PYPMM constructions is based on the truncated stick-breaking representation introduced in [1]. The variational posterior distribution over GMM parameters is calculated as proposed in [2] and the variational posterior distribution over VMFMM parameters as proposed in [3]. The variational method and numerical approximations applied in the VMFMM posterior estimation are also presented in the enclosed documentation [approximate variational inference in DPVMFMM](approximate-variational-inference.pdf).
